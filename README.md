Functionality used for biocompatibility study

Functions used to analyse histological images obtained from the biocompatibility study. These functions are used to quantify the effect of the probe on the remaining tissue by comparing regions close to the probe to regions far from the probe. In the case of GFAP and IBA1, the intensity was compared, whereas cells were counted in the case of Neun.
